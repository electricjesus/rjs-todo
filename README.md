RequireJS Test
==============

This is a quick proof-of-concept repo/boilerplate in preparation for major refactors for our in-house projects. 

To demonstrate a working project structure, the included demo app is a simple and very modular Todo app. 

v0.0.1 


### Installing

 - npm install && bower install
 - must have grunt-cli and bower-cli installed.

### Using

 - to start the project, use 'grunt'
 - local server is on `localhost:9001`.


## Todos

 - optimize the defined modules with `r.js` and find out how to integrate a `*.build.js` file so as to minimize requesets
 - include `jasmine` tests.
